READMENOTES:1. The project is in python 2.7. So, to run a program you will be needing a python environment and also need to import packages pandas and Scipy. I have implemented this program in Jupyter development environment.2. Please change the path of the input data in the program.3. For N=200 there is a file name FARFRRN200 where you can change the threshold value in Ôthr= Ôattribute and can get output for different threshold values. Same goes for N=100(FARFRR100) and N=300(FARFRR300).4.  All the output files are in the output folder and code file in the code folder.
